# Run 2k21 - Hackathon

## Backstory
I wanted to start streaming code for a while. The idea was to stream a project from start to finish with nothing planned in spanish, as I think there's a lack of advanced content in this language.

The idea was to speak my ideas out loud and share how I approach this kind of projects. One day, the perfect concept come up: an online multiplayer chess game with rooms! I would develop both the frontend and the backend with many different technologies in mind: canvas, maths, classes, webpack, typescript, sockets and deploy.

I streamed 7 parts, 2 hours every week. It's not perfect and it's still missing a lot of things, but I'm pretty happy with the length of it and how it turned out.

You can the streams here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQJhKDKjHqZ6kqNp6pV7yiqdRcIcdyXuC
And the original code is here: https://gitlab.com/matias.bontempo/chess-multiplayer-js

## Idea
When I discovered this hackathon I had no doubts about what I wanted to do: let's have the chess matches on the blockchain! I think it can be the perfect wrap up for my chess series and also it could be an interesting concept to have as a way to audit the matches.
